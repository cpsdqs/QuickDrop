# QuickDrop
Upload screenshots (or files) to Imgur. Slightly buggy.

## Usage
QuickDrop requires a config file at `~/.config/quickdrop-config` to contain the Imgur client ID token.

The `Alt`+`Shift`+`Command`+`4` and `Alt`+`Shift`+`Command`+`3` shortcuts are global.

This uses CocoaPods so `pod install` is required before building.
